# Robot Simulation

This repository contains a simulation framework for robotic systems.

## Overview

The project provides tools and resources for simulating robots, allowing users to test and validate algorithms in a controlled environment. The simulation is implemented in Python.

## Features

- Robot simulation environment
- Tools for testing and validating robotic algorithms
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MatijaMikulic/RobotSimulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd RobotSimulation
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
   ```sh
   cd src
   ```
2. Run the simulation script:
   ```sh
   python simulation.py
   ```
